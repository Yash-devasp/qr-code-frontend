## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

It may be a baby step but I learned to center a div on a page. I learned how to add google fonts in a web page. Learned to work with css selectors.

To align every element in the card, I have used Flexbox:

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I have used flex in the card but I am not sure if this is the correct way to use it and I am planning to extend it further. Also, I am working on grasping the different sizing units as I am still confused where I should use which unit.

### Useful resources

- [How to center a div](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - This helped me to align the card in the position I wanted it to align.
- [Working with Google fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_google.asp) - This is a well written article by w3school which helped me in understanding how to incorporate the fonts in my web page.

This is a project that I worked on my own but I would like to give credit to Ahmed Sadek whose creative css artwork course helped me get over the fear of CSS.
